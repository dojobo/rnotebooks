## About the presenter

Dominic Bordelon, Research Data Librarian

## Suggestion: update R + RStudio

R and RStudio are both under very active development, and RNotebooks is where a lot of the new features are!

If your features don't exactly match what I show, try updating your installations. (Of course, I might also be behind!)

## File types in R

Other R file types, which are *not* notebooks: `.RData, .RProject, .RDS`

## Markup languages

-   "Marking up" a text document with structure $\rightarrow$ markup language
-   The most famous: HTML (hypertext markup language), `.html` files
-   The most widespread: XML (extensible markup language), `.xml` files
-   ...but they are unpleasant to read and write in

## Markdown

Markdown replaces this:

``` {{html}}
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Item one</li>
  <li>Item two at <a href="https://pitt.edu/">Pitt</a></li>
  <li>Item three</li>
</ul>
```

With this:

``` {{md}}
## Background

* Item one
* Item two at [https://pitt.edu/](Pitt)
* Item three
```

Convenient!

Markdown is used on Wikipedia and GitHub. Usually it has the file extension `.md`. The classic reference for generic Markdown is [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). [GitHub's markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) also has its own features and is called "GitHub Flavored Markdown."

## YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

(or "YAML Ain't a Markup Language")

-   [structured]{.underline} information with minimal markup
-   YAML is often used for configuration
-   In RNotebooks, YAML is the formatting you see in headers.
-   Protip: if you get an error that mentions YAML, check your notebook header for typos
-   Curious about YAML? More at [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)

## RMarkdown (.Rmd) and Quarto documents (.qmd)

RMarkdown is Markdown plus special features for R. And Quarto is the newest iteration of RMarkdown. It's a rebranding in part to reflect a broader user base---you can also run Python and Julia code in RNotebooks---but it also has newer features over the previous RMarkdown. Slides are especially well developed.

RMarkdown's key feature is code chunks (aka code blocks). A code chunk is a "fenced" area---delimited with three backticks ```` ``` ````---in the markdown document which will get interpreted as R code, and can be executed.

Here is what a code chunk looks like:

```{r}
# R code goes here
```

Clicking â–¶ at top right of the chunk will run it and display the results directly below. If you change the code and run it again, there will be new results. It's like a miniature script. But all chunks in the same notebook share the same environment.

You can run a single line with Ctrl+Enter (Windows) / Cmd+Enter (Mac).

## Rich text features

You can use these easily in Visual editing mode.

-   Headings, **bold**, *italics*, [underline]{.underline}, `code`, ~~strikeout~~, [Small Caps]{.smallcaps}
-   Lists (outlines)
-   Inline LaTeX: $H' = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{R}p_i\ln p_i$
-   Display LaTeX:

$$
H' = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{R}p_i \ln p_i
$$

-   Hypertext
-   Images
    -   Features for captions and layout (e.g., side-by-side, grid), alignment, size
-   Tables (I've used one above)
-   HTML (you can generally put it in---it is permitted in markdown)

## Rendering aka knitting

When we "render" or "knit" an RNotebook, it means to compile it into some other (usually rich) format---Word Doc, PDF, etc---as well as run the R code in the notebook and display its results in the final file. The application that RMarkdown/Quarto uses for this is called [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). (It can convert between many formats, and is available as a standalone app.)

You can choose which format(s) a notebook will render in its header, and press the Render button to process it. In case more than one format is specified, you'll also get a caret menu.

Example document: authoring.qmd

## Quarto Slides

-   Try File \> New \> Quarto Presentation...
-   or change/add one of these formats to your notebook YAML header: `revealjs, pptx, beamer`
-   revealjs is a JavaScript library for making browser-based slideshows
-   pptx is PowerPoint
-   beamer is a popular LaTeX package for making PDF slides

*But how?*

-   Every h2 becomes a new slide with that title
-   Or to make a new slide without a title, use a horizontal rule

Example file: index.qmd

## Jupyter Notebooks vs. RNotebooks

-   Can you do all the same stuff in one as in the other?
    -   Coding---yes, in 3 languages
    -   Document/presentation production---probably fewer features in Jupyter, but the important ones are there for reproducibility and legibility.
-   Technical differences
    -   Jupyter runs as a server and provides a web-based environment

    -   (I prefer RStudio as a desktop client, rather than a browser-based IDE, but this is my preference)

    -   Jupyter notebooks can run on GitHub
